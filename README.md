Project Report on RFM Analysis for Sales Dataset ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“ˆ

I recently completed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a sales dataset, aimed at understanding customer behavior 
and enhancing our marketing strategies. This report outlines the methodology, results, and the substantial benefits RFM analysis brings to the company.

Objectives
The primary objectives of the RFM analysis were:

- Segment Customers: Classify customers based on their purchase history.

- Identify Key Segments: Recognize high-value customers for targeted marketing.

- Optimize Marketing Strategies: Tailor marketing efforts to different customer segments.

- Increase Customer Retention: Implement strategies to retain valuable customers.

Methodology
The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. 
We calculated RFM scores by determining the number of days since the last purchase for recency, counting the number of transactions for frequency, 
and summing the total expenditure for monetary value.
Customers were then assigned scores from 1 to 5 for each RFM component, and segments were created by combining these scores.

Results
Key segments identified included Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, At Risk, and Best Customers. 
Loyal Customers are regular buyers with high frequency and monetary scores, while Potential Loyalists have the potential to become loyal with a bit more engagement. At Risk customers haven't purchased recently but have a history of high expenditure. Best Customers have the highest RFM scores, indicating frequent, recent purchases with high expenditure.

Actionable Strategies

- Best Customers: Reward with exclusive offers and early access to new products.

- Loyal Customers: Offer loyalty programs and personalized discounts.

- Potential Loyalists: Nurture with personalized promotions.

- At Risk: Re-engage with targeted reminders and promotions.

Benefits

The RFM analysis provides significant benefits by improving targeting, increasing retention,
achieving higher ROI through efficient resource allocation, and enhancing customer satisfaction with tailored offers and rewards.
This comprehensive analysis has enabled us to tailor the strategies effectively and drive business growth.

Visual Dashboard and Accessibility

I also created a visual dashboard based on the segmentation in Power BI for easy understanding.
All files related to the project are available in the GitHub repository. This analysis is applicable to all companies,
and anyone who wants to analyze their company performance for free can drop me a message.

Thank you.
